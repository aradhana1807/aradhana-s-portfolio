                    Hello, Aradhana here! Computure Science and Engineering
                    undergraduate from <strong>KiiT University, Bhubaneswar</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My love for photography inspires my passion for creating visually
                    appealing applications. Similar to composing captivating frames, I
                    apply the same artistic touch to my digital projects, carefully tuning
                    colors and contrast for a vibrant user experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love watching anime and listening to songs during my leisure time. I
                    also play games, currently playing Genshin Impact and Honkai Star
                    Rail. All time favourite will always be <strong>Pok√©mon</strong>.
